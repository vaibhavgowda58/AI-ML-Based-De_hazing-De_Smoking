# AI-ML-Based-De_hazing-De_Smoking
This research project focuses on developing an AI and Machine Learning-powered real-time video enhancement system to remove haze, smoke, and low-visibility artifacts from indoor fire hazard scenarios. The goal is to improve visibility for rescue teams, surveillance systems, and autonomous robots operating in smoke-filled environments.
